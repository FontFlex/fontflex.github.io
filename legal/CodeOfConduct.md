# FontFlex: Code of Conduct
## Effective Date: Fri July 14th, 2023

FontFlex serves as a professional markdown editor designed for developers, providing a focused environment for their coding needs. Our aim is to create a dedicated space where developers can engage, learn, and share without distractions unrelated to their field.

Scope: All discussions, posts, and activities within FontFlex should pertain to programming and development. Content unrelated to our domain will be promptly removed. This is not meant to disregard your personal beliefs on political or other subjects but rather to maintain the purpose and focus of our platform.

Respectful Interaction: Any form of inappropriate behavior will result in a permanent ban. While we trust our members to understand and uphold principles of respect, professionalism, and decency, we refrain from providing an exhaustive list of inappropriate conduct, assuming that intellectually, morally, and empathetically advanced individuals will inherently adhere to these principles.

Upholding Our Mission: We are dedicated to ensuring that FontFlex remains a distinct, focused community for developers, differentiating itself from platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook. Therefore, we are committed to eliminating content that is unrelated to our profession and preserving the essence of our platform.

Community Responsibility: We greatly value your commitment to maintaining the professional integrity of FontFlex. Thank you for fostering a positive environment, showing respect for yourself and others, and making constructive contributions to our network.

Our Code of Conduct is in place to uphold the quality, relevance, and positive spirit of FontFlex. We appreciate your cooperation and understanding in making this markdown editor a valuable resource for all developers. Furthermore, we are pleased to offer FontFlex as a free addition to applications, providing developers with an enhanced markdown editing experience.
